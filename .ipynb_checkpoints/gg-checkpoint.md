# README: - House Price Prediction using random forest regression

This repository contains the documentation and code for a machine learning project focused on predicting house prices using a Random Forest Regression model. The project is divided into several

sections, including data loading, preprocessing, visualization, model implementation, training, and
evaluation..

Below is a detailed breakdown of the project structure and steps. 
 
# Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict house prices based on various features such as area, number of
bedrooms, bathrooms, stories, and other categorical variables. 

The dataset used is house-price.csv, which contains 545 rows and 13 columns. 

The project follows a structured workflow, from dataexploration to model evaluation.

# Project Structure

The project is divided into the following sections:

# Data Loading and Initial Exploration
# Data Preprocessing and Analysis
# Data Visualization and Analysis
# Model Implementation and Training
# Model Evaluation and Analysis

Each section is documented in detail in the ml-assignment2.docx file, and the corresponding code is
provided in a Jupyter Notebook (housePrice.ipynb). 

# Data Loading and Initial Exploration

# Key Steps:

Import Libraries: Essential Python libraries such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit￾learn are imported. 

Load Dataset: The dataset is loaded from house-price.csv using pandas. 

Initial Exploration: The first few rows, shape, column names, data types, and summary statistics of
the dataset are displayed. 

Key Insights: The dataset contains 545 rows and 13 columns, with no missing values. 

It includes both numerical and categorical features. 

# Next Steps:

Data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and feature engineering. 

# 2. Data Preprocessing and Analysis

# Key Steps:

Identify Numerical Features: Numerical features are identified and summarized. 

# Summary Statistics: 

# Descriptive statistics for all features are generated. 

Check for Missing Values: Missing values are checked, and none are found. Detect Outliers: Outliers are detected using boxplots and handled by capping values at the 99th

percentile. Check Data Quality: Inconsistencies in numerical and categorical features are checked.

One-Hot Encoding: Categorical features are encoded using one-hot encoding for machine learning. 

# Summary:

The dataset is cleaned, outliers are handled, and categorical features are encoded for modeling. 3. Data Visualization and Analysis
Key Steps:

Scatter Plots: Relationships between numerical features and the target variable (price) are visualized. 

Box Plots: Distribution of prices across categorical features is visualized. 

Correlation Heatmap: Correlation between numerical features and the target variable is analyzed. Pair Plot: Pairwise relationships between all features are visualized. 

Histograms and Count Plots: Distribution of house prices and categorical features are analyzed. 

# Summary:

Visualizations provide insights into the relationships between features and the target variable, helping
to guide feature selection and model building. 

# 4. Model Implementation and Training

# Key Steps:

Split Dataset: The dataset is split into training and testing sets (80% training, 20% testing). Preprocessing Pipeline: Numerical features are scaled, and categorical features are encoded usingColumnTransformer and Pipeline. 

Build Model: A Random Forest Regression model is built using a pipeline that combines preprocessing
and the model. 

Hyperparameter Tuning: Grid Search is used to find the best hyperparameters for the model. 

# Summary:

The model is trained and optimized using Grid Search, ensuring the best possible performance. 5. Model Evaluation and Analysis

# Key Steps:

Evaluate Model: The model is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean
Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R²). 

Train Final Model: The final model is trained with the best hyperparameters found during Grid Search. 

Make Predictions: Predictions are made on the test set. 

Visualize Performance: Actual vs. predicted values and residuals are visualized. 

Compare Against Baseline: The model's performance is compared against a baseline (predicting the

mean of the training target values). 

# Summary:

The model's performance is evaluated using multiple metrics and visualizations. 

# The model

significantly outperforms the baseline, indicating its effectiveness.
